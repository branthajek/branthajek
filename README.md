- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @branthajek
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front-end frameworks, programming paradigms, coding best practices, and how to be a better developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and practicing front-end engineering. After learning the basics (html and css), my biggest focus in recent years has been solidifying my Javascript knowledge. I moved on to focus on Typescript before tackling Angular and all of its many feature, including NgRx. I have no shortage of things that interest me that I intend to learn more about (or dive deeper) such as React, Node JS, GraphQL, Express JS, MongoDB - just to name a few. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email (posted on my profile).
