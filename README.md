- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @branthajek
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front-end frameworks, programming paradigms, best pracices, and how to be a better developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and practicing front-end engineering. After learning the basics (html and css), my biggest focus in recent years has been solidifying my Javascript knowledge. I moved on to focus on Typescript before tackling Angular and all of its many feature, including NgRx. I've dabbled in other things as well, such as React JS, webpack, Jasmine, Protractor, SCSS, Bootstrap, and Material, all of which I intend to continue learning and working with.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email posted on my profile.
